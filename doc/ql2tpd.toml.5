.SH NAME
\f[B]ql2tpd.toml\f[R] - configuration file for \f[B]ql2tpd\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f[B]ql2tpd.toml\f[R] file configures \f[B]ql2tpd\f[R].
It calls out the L2TP tunnels and sessions to establish.
.PP
\f[B]ql2tpd.toml\f[R] is written in the TOML markup langange
(https://toml.io/en/).
.PP
Tunnel and session instances are called out in the configuration file
using named TOML tables.
.PP
Each tunnel or session instance table contains configuration parameters
for that instance as key:value pairs.
.PP
Each tunnel and session has a minimal set of configuration which
\f[B]\f[BI]must\f[B]\f[R] be specified.
.PP
In addition, each tunnel or session entry may call out various optional
key:value pairs which will control \f[B]ql2tpd\f[R]\[cq]s runtime
behaviour.
.PP
These options are generally not required, and \f[B]ql2tpd\f[R] will use
sensible defaults for them if they are not included in the
configuration.
.SS TUNNEL CONFIGURATION
Tunnels are described using named entries in the `tunnel' table.
.PP
Each tunnel entry describes a single tunnel instance, and must call out
at least:
.IP \[bu] 2
the tunnel L2TP version (only L2TPv3 is supported),
.IP \[bu] 2
the tunnels encapsulation protocol,
.IP \[bu] 2
the local IP address,
.IP \[bu] 2
the local tunnel ID,
.IP \[bu] 2
the peer\[cq]s IP address,
.IP \[bu] 2
the peer\[cq]s tunnel ID.
.PP
Here is the full list of tunnel configuration options:
.IP
.EX
# This is a tunnel instance named \[dq]t1\[dq]
[tunnel.t1]

# version specifies the version of the L2TP specification the
# tunnel should use.
# Only \[dq]l2tpv3\[dq] is supported.
version = \[dq]l2tpv3\[dq]

# encap specifies the encapsulation to be used for the tunnel.
# L2TPv3 tunnels may be UDP or IP.
encap = \[dq]udp\[dq]

# local specifies the local address that the tunnel should
# bind its socket to
local = \[dq]127.0.0.1:5000\[dq]

# tid specifies the local tunnel ID of the tunnel.
# Tunnel IDs must be unique for the host.
# L2TPv2 tunnel IDs are 16 bit, and may be in the range 1 - 65535.
# L2TPv3 tunnel IDs are 32 bit, and may be in the range 1 - 4294967295.
tid = 62719

# peer specifies the address of the peer that the tunnel should
# connect its socket to
peer = \[dq]127.0.0.1:5001\[dq]

# ptid specifies the peer\[aq]s tunnel ID for the tunnel.
# The peer\[aq]s tunnel ID must be unique for the peer, and are unrelated
# to the local tunnel ID.
# The rules for tunnel ID range apply to the peer tunnel ID too.
ptid = 72819

# hello_timeout if set enables L2TP keep-alive (HELLO) messages.
# A hello message is sent N milliseconds after the last control
# message was sent or received.  It allows for early detection of
# tunnel failure on quiet connections.
# By default no keep-alive messages are sent.
hello_timeout = 7500 # milliseconds
.EE
.SS SESSION CONFIGURATION
Sessions are described using named entries in the `session' table inside
the parent tunnel table.
.PP
Each session entry describes a single session instance within the parent
tunnel, and must call out at least:
.IP \[bu] 2
the pseudowire type to be used (this must be Ethernet),
.IP \[bu] 2
the local session ID,
.IP \[bu] 2
the peer\[cq]s session ID
.PP
Here is the full list of session configuration options:
.IP
.EX
# This is a session instance called \[dq]s1\[dq] within parent tunnel \[dq]t1\[dq].
# Session instances are always created inside a parent tunnel.
[tunnel.t1.session.s1]

# pseudowire specifies the type of layer 2 frames carried by the session.
# Static sessions support Ethernet pseudowires only.
pseudowire = \[dq]eth\[dq]

# sid specifies the local session ID of the session.
# Session IDs must be unique to the tunnel for L2TPv2, or unique to
# the peer for L2TPv3.
# L2TPv2 session IDs are 16 bit, and may be in the range 1 - 65535.
# L2TPv3 session IDs are 32 bit, and may be in the range 1 - 4294967295.
sid = 12389

# psid specifies the peer\[aq]s session ID for the session.
# The peer\[aq]s session ID is unrelated to the local session ID.
# The rules for the session ID range apply to the peer session ID too.
psid = 1234

# seqnum, if set, enables the transmission of sequence numbers with
# L2TP data messages.  Use of sequence numbers enables the data plane
# to reorder data packets to ensure they are delivered in sequence.
# By default sequence numbers are not used.
seqnum = false

# cookie, if set, specifies the local L2TPv3 cookie for the session.
# Cookies are a data verification mechanism intended to allow misdirected
# data packets to be detected and rejected.
# Transmitted data packets will include the local cookie in their header.
# Cookies may be either 4 or 8 bytes long, and contain aribrary data.
# By default no local cookie is set.
cookie = [ 0x12, 0xe9, 0x54, 0x0f, 0xe2, 0x68, 0x72, 0xbc ]

# peer_cookie, if set, specifies the L2TPv3 cookie the peer will send in
# the header of its data messages.
# Messages received without the peer\[aq]s cookie (or with the wrong cookie)
# will be rejected.
# By default no peer cookie is set.
peer_cookie = [ 0x74, 0x2e, 0x28, 0xa8 ]

# interface_name, if set, specifies the network interface name to be
# used for the session instance.
# By default the Linux kernel autogenerates an interface name specific to
# the pseudowire type, e.g. \[dq]l2tpeth0\[dq], \[dq]ppp0\[dq].
# Setting the interface name can be useful when you need to be certain
# of the interface name a given session will use.
# By default the kernel autogenerates an interface name.
interface_name = \[dq]l2tpeth42\[dq]

# l2spec_type specifies the L2TPv3 Layer 2 specific sublayer field to
# be used in data packet headers as per RFC3931 section 3.2.2.
# Currently supported values are \[dq]none\[dq] and \[dq]default\[dq].
# By default no Layer 2 specific sublayer is used.
l2spec_type = \[dq]default\[dq]
