.SH NAME
ql2tpd - a daemon for creating static (or quiescent) L2TPv3 tunnels and
sessions
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[B]ql2tpd\f[R] [ arguments ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f[B]ql2tpd\f[R] is a daemon for creating static L2TPv3 (RFC 3931)
tunnels and sessions.
.PP
Static (or quiescent) tunnels and sessions implement
\f[B]\f[BI]only\f[B]\f[R] the data plane transport: the L2TP control
protocol is not used.
This can be useful for setting up static L2TPv3 links where host
configuration is known in advance.
.PP
When configured to bring up static tunnel and session instances,
\f[B]ql2tpd\f[R] represents a more convenient way to bring up static
sessions than \f[B]ip l2tp\f[R] commands.
.PP
Additionally, \f[B]ql2tpd\f[R] supports the use of a periodic keep-alive
packet for tunnels it is managing (controlled by the configuration file
\f[B]\f[BI]hello_timeout\f[B]\f[R] parameter).
.PP
This allows for the detection of tunnel failure, which will then tear
down the sessions running in that tunnel.
This mode of operation must only be enabled if the peer is also running
\f[B]ql2tpd\f[R].
.PP
\f[B]ql2tpd\f[R] requires root permissions to run, and is driven by a
configuration file which details the tunnel and session instances to
create.
.PP
For further details of the configuration format, please refer to
\f[B]ql2tpd.toml\f[R](5).
